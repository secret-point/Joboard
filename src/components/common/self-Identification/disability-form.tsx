        <Text>
          We are a federal contractor or subcontractor required by law to provide equal employment opportunity to
          qualified people with disabilities. We are also required to measure our progress toward having at least 7% of
          our workforce be individuals with disabilities. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have
          a disability or have ever had a disability. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we ask all of
          our employees to update their information at least every five years.

        <Text>
          Identifying yourself as an individual with a disability is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do
          so. Your answer will be maintained confidentially and not be seen by selecting officials or anyone else
          involved in making personnel decisions. Completing the form will not negatively impact you in any way,
          regardless of whether you have self-identified in the past. For more information about this form or the equal
          employment obligations of federal contractors under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, visit the U.S.

        <Text>
          You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that
          substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or
          medical condition.
